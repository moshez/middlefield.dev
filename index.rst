Dietary and Exercise Guidance for Heart Health
===============================================

This documentation presents evidence-based guidance for reducing cardiovascular disease risk
through dietary choices and metabolic health management. The recommendations are grounded in
peer-reviewed research and focus on practical, actionable steps.

The core insight linking these documents is the role of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) in atherosclerosis.
Visceral fat accumulation leads to insulin resistance, which combined with high glycemic load
foods causes hyperglycemia. Elevated blood glucose promotes LDL oxidation through glycation,
reactive oxygen species, and other mechanisms. Once oxidized, LDL particles trigger endothelial
dysfunction, foam cell formation, and ultimately atherosclerotic plaque development.

Dietary interventions can address this pathway at multiple points. Consuming antioxidant-rich
whole foods---berries, dark chocolate, coffee, tea, and deeply pigmented vegetables---provides
compounds that support the body's defenses against oxidation. Critically, these benefits come
from whole foods rather than isolated supplements. Additionally, avoiding dietary sources of
pre-oxidized lipids (commercially fried foods, powdered eggs and milk, foods cooked in
repeatedly heated oils) reduces the direct intake of harmful oxidized particles.

For cooking at home, choosing oils high in oleic acid (olive, avocado, canola) rather than
those high in linoleic acid minimizes oxidation during heating. Combined with maintaining
healthy body composition to preserve insulin sensitivity and moderating glycemic load, these
dietary strategies form a comprehensive approach to cardiovascular protection through reducing
oxidative damage to LDL particles.
