Dietary and Exercise Guidance for Heart Health
===============================================

This documentation presents evidence-based guidance for reducing cardiovascular disease risk
through dietary choices and metabolic health management. The recommendations are grounded in
peer-reviewed research and focus on practical, actionable steps.

Eat antioxidant-rich whole foods daily: berries (especially blueberries and blackberries),
dark chocolate (70%+ cacao), coffee, tea, and deeply pigmented vegetables like red cabbage
and tomatoes. These benefits come from whole foods rather than supplements---isolated
antioxidant pills do not reproduce the protective effects seen with food intake.

Avoid sources of pre-oxidized lipids. Skip commercially fried foods, powdered eggs, powdered
milk, and other heavily processed cholesterol-containing products. When cooking at home, use
oils high in oleic acid (olive, avocado, or canola) rather than those high in linoleic acid,
and avoid reusing frying oil multiple times.

Reduce blood glucose spikes after meals by adding fiber, protein, or fat to carbohydrate-rich
foods; consuming vinegar or lemon juice with starchy meals; and eating protein and vegetables
before carbohydrates. Even simple meal reordering---eating the non-starchy components first---can
significantly improve glycemic response without changing what you eat.
