# Avoiding Non-oxLDL Sources of Oxidized Blood Particles

## Avoid commercially fried foods

The benefits of vegetable oil can be deteriorated by repeated heating that leads to lipid oxidation. Prolonged consumption of the repeatedly heated oil has been shown to increase blood pressure and total cholesterol, cause vascular inflammation as well as vascular changes which predispose to atherosclerosis.

## Avoid heavily processed cholesterol-containing foods

Eggs and egg-derived products are the main dietary sources of oxysterols. Thermally-processed milk and milk-derived products are another source of oxysterols in our diet. [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14631863/)

This includes powdered eggs, powdered milk, and similar shelf-stable products where increased temperature during food preparation and heating promotes the oxidation process of cholesterol. Oxysterols have the property of causing the formation of atherosclerosis and accelerating its progression. [Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00636-5)

## When frying at home, use low-linoleic-acid oils

Use oils such as olive oil, avocado oil, or canola oil. The ratios of the rates of oxidation of oleic acid (one double bond) : linoleic acid (two double bonds) : linolenic acid (three double bonds) have been reported as 1:10:20, meaning that linoleic and linolenic acids oxidize 10 and 20 times faster than the oleic acid, respectively.

Oils high in oleic acid (monounsaturated) rather than linoleic acid (polyunsaturated) are therefore more stable during cooking. The more unsaturated and less saturated a fat is, the faster the oxidation reaction proceeds. Linolenic acid is oxidized the fastest, followed by linoleic and oleic acids.
